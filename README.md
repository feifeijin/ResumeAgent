# Resume Angent

This project is a platform for managing resumes efficiently, supporting multiple languages, version control, and customization for specific job descriptions (JDs). It aims to:

1. Maintain a primary language version of a resume for each position.
2. Translate the main version into other languages as needed.
3. Provide version control to track changes and view differences.
4. Allow resume creation tailored to specific JDs.

## Features

- **Single Source Maintenance**: Keep only one language version for each position and easily manage updates.
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatically translate resumes to other languages using translation APIs.
- **Version Control**: Integrated with Git to track changes, compare versions, and roll back if necessary.
- **JD-specific Resumes**: Generate resumes customized to match the requirements of specific job descriptions.
